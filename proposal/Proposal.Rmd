#Expanded functionality to validate Package Installation State

# isInstalled - Checks to determine if the specified R Package has

## 2 Project Name

Yet Another COVID Analysis (YACA)

## 3 Data Description

The Coronavirus Source data file (owid-covid-data) is published and maintained by Our World in Data.  The dataset, which is updated daily, includes data pertaining to worldwide COVID confirmed cases, deaths, as well as various testing and hospitalization measures.

Some of the key variables in this file are:

- Total & New Cases / Deaths 
- Country Population
- Region
- Population Density
- Median Age
- GDP (per capita)
- Diabetes prevalence
- Extreme Poverty Indicator
- Smoking
- Handwashing facilities
- Hospital Beds
- Government Response to Virus

## 4 Background Information

A high level overview of the data/providers can be found at : https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data
<br />
The data, which is updated daily, can be found via GitHub:  https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/

## 5 Statement of Personal/Scientific Interest

While there is a plethora of information about COVID-19 online, it is hard to know how accurate the information presented to us is, from various sources.  By analyzing the data ourselves, we can become better informed about the current pandemic and test our skills on real-world, current data.  We hope to learn insight about how different countriesâ€™ circumstances and responses to the outbreak affected their outcomes, with minimal external bias.

We hope to create smaller models that explain some of the factors that affect the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, while accounting for the assumptions of linear models.  By using cross-validation, training and testing data sets, and variable selection, we hope to build accurate models which eliminate collinearity. However, due to the fact that data is time-based, we think it would be difficult or impossible with our current knowledge level to build a large, accurate, predictive model without  invalidating the assumptions of the linear model.


## 6 Sample of Loaded Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
covid_data = read.csv("owid-covid-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


#Create a list of required packages for this assignment
lstReqPackages = c("knitr","kableExtra")

#Validate Packages
validatePackages(lstReqPackages)

#Activate Packages 
for(pckg in lstReqPackages){ library(pckg,character.only = TRUE)}


```

```{r ShowStructure, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hold", echo = FALSE, out.width="120%"}
#Show the structure of the data file 
cat(" *************************** Structure of owid-covid-data File *************************** ", "\n\n")
str(covid_data)
```

```{r ShowSampleRows, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hold", echo = FALSE, out.width="120%"}
cat(" *************************** Sample Data from owid-covid-data File ***************************  ", "\n\n")


kable(covid_data[sample(nrow(covid_data), 50),]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))  %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "750px")
