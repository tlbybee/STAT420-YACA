While there is a plethora of information about COVID-19 online, it is hard to know how accurate the information presented to us is, from various sources. By analyzing the data ourselves, we can become better informed about the current pandemic and test our skills on real-world, current data. We hope to learn insight about how different countriesâ€™ circumstances and responses to the outbreak affected their outcomes, with minimal bias. Ultimately our goal is to use this data, and our understanding of it, to create a predictive model allowing us to estimate future death rates.

The data that we will be using for this project is provided by Our World In Data. They are a collaboration between researchers at the Unviersity of Oxford and the non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab. Our World in Data focuses on the large problems that will continue to confront humans for centuries and the long-lasting, forceful changes that gradually reshape our world. Given the global, and potentially long lasting, impact of COVID-19, they have created multiple datasets help people analyze it. We will be using their Coronavirus Source Data datset. This dataset is updated daily and contains many relevant variables related to COVID-19 infections, deaths and tests grouped by Country and Continent. A more detailed explanation of the data can be found in Appexndix sections A & B at the end of this report.
